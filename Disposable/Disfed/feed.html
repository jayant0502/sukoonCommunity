                  Once a sailor shared a fascinating insight. He said, ‘when the
                  ship is in the midst of a tempest, and nothing seems to be in
                  favour outside, all passengers in a ship depend on one another
                  seeking confidence, support and reassurance. This is how we
                  manage to keep calm and face the challenging as well as rough
                  weathers!” When goings get tough, only those who stay composed
                  and confident become victorious. The lesson is to shun
                  over-dependence on external factors for inspiration.The
                  internal source imbibed in the synergy of cohabitants has the
                  power to sustain for more extended periods. Spiritually, a
                  sunflower represents happiness, togetherness and growth. Let
                  us all learn these values and imbibe those in our behaviour.
                  Let us try to be like a sunflower!

                  Positive thinking is a mental attitude that admits into the
                  mind thoughts, words and images that are conductive to growth,
                  expansion and success. It is a mental attitude that expects
                  good and favorable results. A positive mind anticipates
                  happiness, joy, health and a successful outcome of every
                  situation and action. Avoid sentences like 'I wish I could
                  have' or 'I wish I should have'. Past is gone and future comes
                  when it comes. Present is what we have so we must make the
                  most out of it. Be natural and be happy with what you are and
                  what you have. Focusing on what you have will give you more
                  happiness instead of pondering over what you lack. These
                  simple suggestions will help you in developing positive
                  thinking in your life. Think Positive!

                  As grandchildren, it is our duty to care for and appreciate
                  the seniors in our family. We have the ability to light up our
                  grandparents’ lives and to bring happiness to their home,
                  giving them a sense of warmth and fulfilment knowing that they
                  are not alone. Visiting them will help us get happier, keep
                  them very happy. The time we have on this earth is short, but
                  the time we have with our grandparents is even shorter. Make
                  the most out of intergenerational interactions with them
                  before we realise it’s too late. You'll certainly not regret
                  it.THis will provide you mental peace and you will able to
                  learn much about life with their experiences.Talking to
                  grandparents is a therapy to them and also to our dull mind.

                  One who lives every moment knows the dark face of life. That
                  anything might happen tomorrow, Holocaust may come, a mishap
                  may occur,someone may break your heart,so we may get
                  disheartened.Life may turn tops turvy. But still, in those
                  difficult, enduring moments of life, we keep our patience,
                  strength, courage and face it with determi nation.Then the
                  moment of life becomes meaningful because we have lived those
                  moments and come out with the grave situation.

                  Also, due to money, they feel insecurity that everyone is
                  after their money so to safeguard their money and them they
                  hire security. While the condition of the poor is just the
                  opposite. They do not have money but they are happy with and
                  stress-free from these problems. In addition, they take care
                  of their wife and children and their divorce rate is also very
                  low.

                  Peace and harmony is the fundamental prerequisite of our life
                  and an ideal path to follow. Many ideas contribute to the
                  logic of peace and harmony such as dealing with disputes,
                  staying calm and focused, resolving conflicts, adjusting,
                  adapting, neutralization, following the ‘middle way’
                  principle, etc. With globalization we are not anymore divided
                  into our concentrated area of state or nation; instead, the
                  world has united with the unprecedented extent of bond
                  regardless of borders and resulting into the formation of a
                  great and happy global community. And to maintain the well
                  being of every individual of this global community, ultimately
                  everyone has to implement the means of peace and harmony into
                  the way of our living!
