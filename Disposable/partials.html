          Once a sailor shared a fascinating insight. He said, ‘when the
          ship is in the midst of a tempest, and nothing seems to be in
          favour outside, all passengers in a ship depend on one another
          seeking confidence, support and reassurance. This is how we
          manage to keep calm and face the challenging as well as rough
          weathers!” When goings get tough, only those who stay composed
          and confident become victorious. The lesson is to shun
          over-dependence on external factors for inspiration.The
          internal source imbibed in the synergy of cohabitants has the
          power to sustain for more extended periods. Spiritually, a
          sunflower represents happiness, togetherness and growth. Let
          us all learn these values and imbibe those in our behaviour.
          Let us try to be like a sunflower!

          Positive thinking is a mental attitude that admits into the
          mind thoughts, words and images that are conductive to growth,
          expansion and success. It is a mental attitude that expects
          good and favorable results. A positive mind anticipates
          happiness, joy, health and a successful outcome of every
          situation and action. Avoid sentences like 'I wish I could
          have' or 'I wish I should have'. Past is gone and future comes
          when it comes. Present is what we have so we must make the
          most out of it. Be natural and be happy with what you are and
          what you have. Focusing on what you have will give you more
          happiness instead of pondering over what you lack. These
          simple suggestions will help you in developing positive
          thinking in your life. Think Positive!

          As grandchildren, it is our duty to care for and appreciate
          the seniors in our family. We have the ability to light up our
          grandparents’ lives and to bring happiness to their home,
          giving them a sense of warmth and fulfilment knowing that they
          are not alone. Visiting them will help us get happier, keep
          them very happy. The time we have on this earth is short, but
          the time we have with our grandparents is even shorter. Make
          the most out of intergenerational interactions with them
          before we realise it’s too late. You'll certainly not regret
          it.THis will provide you mental peace and you will able to
          learn much about life with their experiences.Talking to
          grandparents is a therapy to them and also to our dull mind.

          One who lives every moment knows the dark face of life. That
          anything might happen tomorrow, Holocaust may come, a mishap
          may occur,someone may break your heart,so we may get
          disheartened.Life may turn tops turvy. But still, in those
          difficult, enduring moments of life, we keep our patience,
          strength, courage and face it with determi nation.Then the
          moment of life becomes meaningful because we have lived those
          moments and come out with the grave situation.

          Also, due to money, they feel insecurity that everyone is
          after their money so to safeguard their money and them they
          hire security. While the condition of the poor is just the
          opposite. They do not have money but they are happy with and
          stress-free from these problems. In addition, they take care
          of their wife and children and their divorce rate is also very
          low.

          Peace and harmony is the fundamental prerequisite of our life
          and an ideal path to follow. Many ideas contribute to the
          logic of peace and harmony such as dealing with disputes,
          staying calm and focused, resolving conflicts, adjusting,
          adapting, neutralization, following the ‘middle way’
          principle, etc. With globalization we are not anymore divided
          into our concentrated area of state or nation; instead, the
          world has united with the unprecedented extent of bond
          regardless of borders and resulting into the formation of a
          great and happy global community. And to maintain the well
          being of every individual of this global community, ultimately
          everyone has to implement the means of peace and harmony into
          the way of our living!
